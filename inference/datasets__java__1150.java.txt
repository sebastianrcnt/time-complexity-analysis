<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class DS {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    int x = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

    if (x == 1) System.out.println(-1);
    else System.out.println(x + " " + x);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice]. 

Analysis:

The code reads a single integer 'x' from standard input. It reads a string line by line, so its time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string. Since the input string has only one integer, n=1, which means the time complexity is O(1) for the input operation. 
However, this program performs an operation with time complexity O(x), where x can be a large integer. So, the overall time complexity is O(1) for input operation and O(x) for the output operation, which gives us O(n) for the entire program.</s>
