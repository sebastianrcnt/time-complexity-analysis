Given Code:
/**
 * @file
 * @brief Implementation of an algorithm to solve the [jumping game]((https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)) problem
 * @details
 * **Problem statement:** Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Determine if you are able to reach the last index.
 * This solution takes in input as a vector and output as a boolean to check if you can reach the last position.
 * We name the indices good and bad based on whether we can reach the destination if we start at that position.
 * We initialize the last index as lastPos.
 * Here, we start from the end of the array and check if we can ever reach the first index.
 * We check if the sum of the index and the maximum jump count given is greater than or equal to the lastPos.
 * If yes, then that is the last position you can reach starting from the back.
 * After the end of the loop, if we reach the lastPos as 0, then the destination can be reached from the start position.

Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]2.


Explanation:

The time complexity of the given Algorithm is O(n).


The outer loop runs n times. Each iteration of the outer loop runs a constant number of instructions (O(1)). The while loop runs n times. Each iteration of the while loop runs a constant number of instructions (O(1)). Therefore, the time complexity of the given algorithm is O(n).


Option [choice]1 (O(logn)) is incorrect because we are traversing the array linear fashion and not using any logarithmic data structure.

Option [choice]0 (O(1)) is incorrect because the size of the array is unknown, hence we can't make an O(1) assertion.

Option [choice]3 (O(nlogn)) is incorrect because we are not using any sorting algorithm or any logarithmic data structure.

Option [choice]4 (O(n^2)) is incorrect because we are only iterating the array once, hence we don't have any nested loop over n elements.</s>
