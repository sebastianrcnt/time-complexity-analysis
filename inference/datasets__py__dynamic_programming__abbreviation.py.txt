Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])

Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Given Code:
    """
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/abbr/problem
You can perform the following operation on some string, :

1. Capitalize zero or more of 's lowercase letters at some index i
   (i.e., make them uppercase).
2. Delete all of the remaining lowercase letters in .

Example:
a=daBcd and b="ABC"
daBcd -> capitalize a and c(dABCd) -> remove d (ABC)

[choice]1[/choice] Since we need to maintain dp[i][j] based on previously seen characters in both strings, we have to use nested loops and comparisons within them. This means the time complexity of the function is O(n \* m), where n is the length of the first string and m is the length of the second string.</s>
