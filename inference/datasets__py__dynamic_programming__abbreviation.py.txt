Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
"""
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/abbr/problem
You can perform the following operation on some string, :

1. Capitalize zero or more of 's lowercase letters at some index i
   (i.e., make them uppercase).
2. Delete all of the remaining lowercase letters in .

Example:
a=daBcd and b="ABC"
daBcd -> capitalize a and c(dABCd) -> remove d (ABC)
"""


def abbr(a: str, b: str) -> bool:
    """
    >>> abbr("daBcd", "ABC")
    True
    >>> abbr("dBcd", "ABC")
    False
    """
    n = len(a)
    m = len(b)
    dp = [[False for _ in range(m + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m + 1):
            if dp[i][j]:
                if j < m and a[i].upper() == b[j]:
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = True
                if a[i].islower():
                    dp[i + 1][j] = True
    return dp[n][m]

    import doctest

    doctest.testmod()


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice] O(nlogn). The function abbr has two nested loops where the outer loop runs n times and the inner loop runs m times. So, the total time complexity of the function is O(n\*m) which is O(nlogn) in the worst case.</s>
