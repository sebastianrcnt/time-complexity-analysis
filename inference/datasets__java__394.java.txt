Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
class Node {

  int data;

  Node left, right;

  Node(int item) {

    data = item;

    left = right = null;
  }
}

class BinaryTree {

  Node root;

  void printLeaves(Node node) {

    if (node != null) {

      printLeaves(node.left);

      if (node.left == null && node.right == null) System.out.print(node.data + " ");

      printLeaves(node.right);
    }
  }

  void printBoundaryLeft(Node node) {

    if (node != null) {

      if (node.left != null) {

        System.out.print(node.data + " ");

        printBoundaryLeft(node.left);

      } else if (node.right != null) {

        System.out.print(node.data + " ");

        printBoundaryLeft(node.right);
      }
    }
  }

  void printBoundaryRight(Node node) {

    if (node != null) {

      if (node.right != null) {

        printBoundaryRight(node.right);

        System.out.print(node.data + " ");

      } else if (node.left != null) {

        printBoundaryRight(node.left);

        System.out.print(node.data + " ");
      }
    }
  }

  void printBoundary(Node node) {

    if (node != null) {

      System.out.print(node.data + " ");

      printBoundaryLeft(node.left);

      printLeaves(node.left);

      printLeaves(node.right);

      printBoundaryRight(node.right);
    }
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {

    BinaryTree tree = new BinaryTree();

    tree.root = new Node(20);

    tree.root.left = new Node(8);

    tree.root.left.left = new Node(4);

    tree.root.left.right = new Node(12);

    tree.root.left.right.left = new Node(10);

    tree.root.left.right.right = new Node(14);

    tree.root.right = new Node(22);

    tree.root.right.right = new Node(25);

    tree.printBoundary(tree.root);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice] which is O(logn). When you run the code and analyze its performance, it will most likely take almost constant time to execute. This is because all the operations in the code are occurring only at the root node of the tree, which can be computed logarithmically fast in a binary search tree.

The functions that are being called in the code are:

* printLeaves(): This recursively traverses the left and right children of the current node and prints all the leaf nodes of the tree. It works in O(n) time in the worst case.
* printBoundaryLeft(): This recursively traverses the left child of the current node and prints all the nodes that are on the left boundary of the current node.
* printBoundaryRight(): This recursively traverses the right child of the current node and prints all the nodes that are on the right boundary of the current node.
* printBoundary(): This function combines the previous three functions and prints all the nodes that are on the left, right, and bottom boundaries of the current node. It works in O(nlogn) time in the worst case.

The main function creates a binary tree and calls the printBoundary() function on it, which recursively traverses the tree and prints out all the nodes that are on the left, right, and bottom boundaries of the tree. Since there are only O(logn) nodes that are on the boundaries, the function performs well in constant time.</s>
