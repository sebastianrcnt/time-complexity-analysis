Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;

class GFG {

  static void spiralPrint(int m, int n, int a[][]) {

    int i, k = 0, l = 0;

    while (k < m && l < n) {

      for (i = l; i < n; ++i) {

        System.out.print(a[k][i] + " ");
      }

      k++;

      for (i = k; i < m; ++i) {

        System.out.print(a[i][n - 1] + " ");
      }

      n--;

      if (k < m) {

        for (i = n - 1; i >= l; --i) {

          System.out.print(a[m - 1][i] + " ");
        }

        m--;
      }

      if (l < n) {

        for (i = m - 1; i >= k; --i) {

          System.out.print(a[i][l] + " ");
        }

        l++;
      }
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int R = 3;

    int C = 6;

    int a[][] = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}};

    spiralPrint(R, C, a);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice]. 


Here's the reasoning:

1. We have an array a[][] of size R x C and we are using two pointers k and l to traverse the array.
2. In each iteration, we perform k steps and l steps in the spiral pattern.
3. k and l increase by 1 in each iteration, until they cross paths.
4. Since we are performing a constant number of operations per iteration (k and l steps), the overall time complexity is determined by the number of iterations.
5. The time taken to execute the loop while k < m and l < n is O(nlogn).
6. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(nlogn).</s>
