Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
class BinomialCoefficient {

  static int binomialCoeff(int n, int k) {

    int C[][] = new int[n + 1][k + 1];

    int i, j;

    for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) {

      for (j = 0; j <= min(i, k); j++) {

        if (j == 0 || j == i) C[i][j] = 1;
        else C[i][j] = C[i - 1][j - 1] + C[i - 1][j];
      }
    }

    return C[n][k];
  }

  static int min(int a, int b) {

    return (a < b) ? a : b;
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {

    int n = 5, k = 2;

    System.out.println("Value of C(" + n + "," + k + ") is " + binomialCoeff(n, k));
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice].

The reason for this is that there are two nested loops in the binomialCoeff function, where one loop is iterating 'n' times and the other is iterating 'k' times. Thus, the total number of iterations is n x k. 

In the worst case scenario, both n and k are at their maximum values. 

Since n = 5 and k = 2, this equates to a total of 10 iterations. 

Therefore, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice].</s>
