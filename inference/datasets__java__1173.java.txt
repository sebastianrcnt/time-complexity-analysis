<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner kai = new Scanner(System.in);
    while (kai.hasNext()) {
      int a = kai.nextInt();
      if ((a & 1) == 0) {
        System.out.println("Mahmoud");
      } else {
        System.out.println("Ehab");
      }
    }
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]2[/choice]. The O notation used above represents a linear time complexity. The while loop in the given code runs n number of times, and the operations performed in the loop also has a linear time complexity. Hence the overall time complexity of the given code is O(n).</s>
