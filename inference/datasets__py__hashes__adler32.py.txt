    Adler-32 is a checksum algorithm which was invented by Mark Adler in 1995.
    Compared to a cyclic redundancy check of the same length, it trades reliability for
    speed (preferring the latter).
    Adler-32 is more reliable than Fletcher-16, and slightly less reliable than
    Fletcher-32.[2]
