Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    int q = scan.nextInt();
    int i;
    for (i = 1; i <= q; i++) {
      int a = scan.nextInt();
      int ans = a / 7 + 1;
      System.out.println(ans);
    }
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice].

Explanation: The time complexity of the given code depends on the size of the input, where there should be n integers given as an input. And the for loop iterates n times, so the time complexity will be O(n). The constant time O(1) operations are used in the given code, such as creating a new Scanner object and printing the answer, so they are not considered in the time complexity of the given code. Therefore, the time complexity of the given code is O(n).</s>
