Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])

Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Given Code:
    /*
 * Problem Statement: Given a positive number `num`, find it's binary equivalent using recursion
 *
 * What is Binary Equivalent?
 * - In binary number system, a number is represented in terms of 0s and 1s,
 *   for example:
 *    - Binary Of 2 = 10
 *    - Binary of 3 = 11
 *    - Binary of 4 = 100
 *
 * Reference on how to find Binary Equivalent

  if (num === 0 || num === 1) {
    return String(num)
  }
  return binaryEquivalent(Math.floor(num / 2)) + String(num % 2)
