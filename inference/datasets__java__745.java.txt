<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.util.*;

public class helloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    long n = in.nextLong();
    long m = in.nextLong();

    long ans = m / n;

    if (m % n > 0) ans++;

    System.out.println(ans);

    in.close();
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice]. This is because both inputs are read from standard input using the nextLong() method of the Scanner class. Since Scanner reads inputs sequentially, the overall time complexity is O(logn), assuming that the input n is much larger than m.</s>
