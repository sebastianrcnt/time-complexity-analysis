Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.util.*;

class MinimumCostPath {

  private static int min(int x, int y, int z) {

    if (x < y) return (x < z) ? x : z;
    else return (y < z) ? y : z;
  }

  private static int minCost(int cost[][], int m, int n) {

    int i, j;

    int tc[][] = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

    tc[0][0] = cost[0][0];

    for (i = 1; i <= m; i++) tc[i][0] = tc[i - 1][0] + cost[i][0];

    for (j = 1; j <= n; j++) tc[0][j] = tc[0][j - 1] + cost[0][j];

    for (i = 1; i <= m; i++)
      for (j = 1; j <= n; j++)
        tc[i][j] = min(tc[i - 1][j - 1], tc[i - 1][j], tc[i][j - 1]) + cost[i][j];

    return tc[m][n];
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {

    int cost[][] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 8, 2}, {1, 5, 3}};

    System.out.println(minCost(cost, 2, 2));
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]4[/choice]. Here are the explanations for the options:

    0. O(1): This option is incorrect because the function min() takes three arguments, and the time complexity of a function depends on the number of its arguments.

    1. O(logn): This option is incorrect because the function minCost() uses nested loops that iterate over n coordinates to construct the table tc, so its time complexity is O(n). But if we denote the time complexity of the outer loop by T, and the time complexity of the inner loops by t, then the time complexity of the function is T*t = O(T*n) = O(nlogn) for some number of iterations T of the outer loop.
    
    2. O(n): This option is correct for the outer loop of the function. Each iteration of the outer loop takes O(n) operations, namely, constructing the table tc up to the current i-th row. Therefore, the time complexity of the function is O(n). However, this option is incorrect because the inner loops take O(n) operations as well, which would cause the overall time complexity to be O(n^2).
    
    3. O(nlogn): This option is correct because the inner loops of the function take O(1) operations for each given i and j, so their time complexity is O(n^2). But the table tc is constructed using nested loops that take O(n) operations for each iteration, which would cause the overall time complexity to be O(nlogn) for some number of iterations T of the outer loop.
    
    4. O(n^2): This option is correct because the function takes O(n^2) operations to construct the table tc from scratch. Note that this option is also correct because each inner loop takes O(1) operations for given i and j, and the total number of rows and columns of the table is O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n^2).</s>
