<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.util.*;

public class Pizza {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    long num = sc.nextLong() + 1;
    sc.close();
    System.out.println(num % 2 == 0 || num == 1 ? num / 2 : num);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice]. The reason is that the code reads a single input value (n), so the number of iterations is proportional to n (in the order of O(n)). Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).</s>
