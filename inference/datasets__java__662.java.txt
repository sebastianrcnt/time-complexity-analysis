Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.util.*;

public class Polycarp {

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
    int rem[] = new int[3];

    Arrays.fill(rem, -1);
    rem[0] = 0;
    char ch[] = s.next().toCharArray();
    int n = ch.length;
    long dp[] = new long[n];

    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < ch.length; i++) {
      sum = sum + (ch[i] - 48);
      if (rem[sum % 3] != -1)
        if (i > 0) {
          dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[rem[sum % 3]] + 1);
        } else dp[i] = 1;
      else if (i > 0) dp[i] = dp[i - 1];

      rem[sum % 3] = i;
      sum = sum % 3;
    }

    System.out.println(dp[n - 1]);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1.

Explanation:
The time complexity of the given code is O(nlogn) because there are n iterations over the characters in the input string (where n is the length of the string), which are done in constant time. The sum is taking O(logn) time through the iteration. The next step, if rem[sum % 3] != -1, requires traversing the integer array rem in O(1) time since it is a constant size array using Arrays.fill(). The dp array also has a size of n and is updated for each character in the string, taking O(n) time. Finally, finding max(dp[iâˆ’1], dp[rem[sum % 3]] + 1) takes O(logn) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the given code is O(nlogn).</s>
