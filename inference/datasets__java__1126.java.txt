Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.BufferedOutputStream;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class EhabAndAnotherConstructionProblem {
  public static BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
  public static PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedOutputStream(System.out));
  public static StringTokenizer st;

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    int x = nextInt();
    System.out.println(x == 1 ? -1 : x + " " + x);
  }

  public static String nextLine() throws IOException {
    return in.readLine();
  }

  public static String nextString() throws IOException {
    while (st == null || !st.hasMoreTokens()) st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());
    return st.nextToken();
  }

  public static int nextInt() throws IOException {
    return Integer.parseInt(nextString());
  }

  public static long nextLong() throws IOException {
    return Long.parseLong(nextString());
  }

  public static int[] intArray(int n) throws IOException {
    int[] a = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] = nextInt();
    return a;
  }

  public static int[][] intArray(int n, int m) throws IOException {
    int[][] a = new int[n][m];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) a[i][j] = nextInt();
    return a;
  }

  public static long[] longArray(int n) throws IOException {
    long[] a = new long[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] = nextLong();
    return a;
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice] O(logn).


Explanation:
1. We are reading input one line at a time using BufferedReader, which has O(1) time complexity, because the read operation is constant time regardless of the size of the input.
2. We are tokenizing the input string line by line using StringTokenizer, which has a constant time setup and O(n) time complexity for tokenization, where n is the length of the input string. Therefore, overall time complexity of StringTokenizer for n lines is O(1 + n) = O(n).
3. However, in the given code, we are reading one line (and tokenizing it) at a time. Therefore, overall time complexity of the entire program is O(n), where n is the total number of lines in the input.
4. We are tokenizing the input string line by line using StringTokenizer, which has a constant time setup and O(n) time complexity for tokenization (where n is the length of the input string).
5. We are using recursion to compute the answer, which has O(n) time complexity in the worst case.
6. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the given code is O(n) + O(n) = O(n).</s>
