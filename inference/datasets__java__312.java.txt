<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
class GFG {

  static int countSeq(int n) {

    int nCr = 1, res = 1;

    for (int r = 1; r <= n; r++) {

      nCr = (nCr * (n + 1 - r)) / r;

      res += nCr * nCr;
    }

    return res;
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {

    int n = 2;

    System.out.print("Count of sequences is ");

    System.out.println(countSeq(n));
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]4[/choice]. This is because the given code uses two nested loops, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2).</s>
