<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.*;

public class programA {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
    int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
    int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
    int t1 = (int) Math.ceil((double) n * 2 / k);
    int t2 = (int) Math.ceil((double) n * 5 / k);
    int t3 = (int) Math.ceil((double) n * 8 / k);
    System.out.println(t1 + t2 + t3);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice].


Explanation:
The given code reads two integers n and k from the user using BufferedReader and StringTokenizer classes, and calculates three sums t1, t2 and t3. Then it prints the sum of these three variables.

The calculation of t1, t2 and t3 involves only division and ceiling operations, which take constant time complexity. Therefore the time complexity of the code is determined by the I/O operations.

Since the BufferedReader reads a line from the user, and StringTokenizer tokenizes the line, we can say that the code's time complexity is O(logn), because the size of the line is n and tokenization takes place using StringTokenizer which uses division and logarithm operations internally.

Therefore, the choice of [choice]1[/choice] is correct.</s>
