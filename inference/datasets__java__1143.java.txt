Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]2.[/choice].
The code reads the input and performs basic arithmetic operations on it. The number of arithmetic operations is directly proportional to the size of the input. Specifically, it performs four arithmetic operations on the four numbers in the input, which are all of the same order of magnitude. Therefore, the asymptotic time complexity of the given code is O(n), where n is the size of the input.

Option [choice]0.[/choice] is not a valid option here because the number of characters read as input is directly proportional to the size of the input. Therefore, the number of characters read grows linearly with the size of the input, which is not constant.

Option [choice]1.[/choice] is not a valid option here because there are no logarithmic operations in the code. So it is not possible for the time complexity to be O(logn).

Option [choice]3.[/choice] is not a valid option here because the output size of the code is the same as the input size. So it is not possible for the time complexity to be O(nlogn).

Option [choice]4.[/choice] is not a valid option here because the number of arithmetic operations in the code is constant. Specifically, it performs four arithmetic operations on the four input numbers. So the number of arithmetic operations does not depend on the size of the input, but rather on a fixed constant. Therefore, the time complexity of the code cannot be O(n^2).

Therefore, the only valid option among the given options is [choice]2.[/choice]. The time complexity of the given code is O(n), where n is the size of the input.</s>
