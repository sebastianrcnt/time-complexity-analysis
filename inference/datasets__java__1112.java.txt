<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class A {
  public static void main(String ar[]) throws Exception {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    String s1[] = br.readLine().split(" ");
    int n = Integer.parseInt(s1[0]);
    int S = Integer.parseInt(s1[1]);
    if (S % n == 0) System.out.println(S / n);
    else System.out.println(S / n + 1);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice]. This is because the code performs a constant amount of operations regardless of the size of the input, so it is constant time. 

Explanation: 
- The code first reads a line from stdin and splits it on a single space, which takes constant time.
- It then parses the input as an integer, which also takes constant time.
- It then performs some conditionals based on the size of S and n, which also take constant time.

Overall, the code takes constant time, so it falls under the category of O(logn), as there is only a single instruction in this case, regardless of the input size.

Therefore, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice].</s>
