Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.*;

public class Main implements Runnable {
  static String readLn(int maxLength) {

    byte line[] = new byte[maxLength];
    int length = 0;
    int input = -1;
    try {
      while (length < maxLength) {
        input = System.in.read();
        if ((input < 0) || (input == '\n')) {
          break;
        }

        line[length++] += input;
      }

      if ((input < 0) && (length == 0)) {
        return null;
      }

      return new String(line, 0, length);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      return null;
    }
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Main myWork = new Main();
    myWork.run();
  }

  public void run() {
    new Watermelon().run();
  }
}

class Watermelon implements Runnable {
  public void run() {
    String line = Main.readLn(100).trim();
    int weight = Integer.parseInt(line);
    System.out.println(weight % 2 == 0 && weight > 2 ? "YES" : "NO");
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]2[/choice]. The reason for this is that the run method of the Main class calls the run method of the Watermelon class, which in turn calls the readLn method of the Main class. The readLn method reads a line from the standard input and returns it as a string. However, the time taken to read a line from the standard input is directly proportional to the length of the line. In this case, the length of the line is fixed at 100, so the time taken to read a line is constant. Since the run method of the Watermelon class is called twice within the run method of the Main class, the overall time taken by the program is also constant. Therefore, the time complexity of the given code is O(n), where n is the number of times the run method of the Watermelon class is called.</s>
