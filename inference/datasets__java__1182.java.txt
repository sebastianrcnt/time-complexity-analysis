<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.util.*;

public class A {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    long n = sc.nextLong();
    if (n == 0) System.out.println(0);
    else if (n % 2 == 1) System.out.println((n + 1) / 2);
    else System.out.println(n + 1);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]0[/choice]. Since the program has a constant time running of 1, its time complexity is constant, which is denoted by O(1).</s>
