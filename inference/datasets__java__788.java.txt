<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Three {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);

    pair[] points = new pair[3];
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
      int x = in.nextInt();
      int y = in.nextInt();
      points[i] = new pair(x, y);
    }

    Arrays.sort(points);

    int MaxY = Math.max(Math.max(points[0].y, points[1].y), points[2].y);
    int MinY = Math.min(Math.min(points[0].y, points[1].y), points[2].y);

    out.println(MaxY - MinY + points[2].x - points[0].x + 1);
    for (int i = MinY; i <= MaxY; ++i) out.println(points[1].x + " " + i);
    for (int i = points[0].x; i < points[1].x; ++i) out.println(i + " " + points[0].y);
    for (int i = points[1].x + 1; i <= points[2].x; ++i) out.println(i + " " + points[2].y);

    out.close();
  }

  public static class pair implements Comparable<pair> {
    int x, y;

    public pair(int x_, int y_) {
      x = x_;
      y = y_;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(pair o) {
      return x - o.x;
    }
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice].

This is because there are three loops in the provided code - two of them are nested loops (for loop within a for loop) which have a total complexity of O(n). The outer for loop runs for three iterations and the inner loops run as many times as the size of the array is which is n. Hence, the overall time complexity of the code is O(nlogn).</s>
