<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.util.*;

public class HelloWorld {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    final long MOD = 1000000007;
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    int now = 1;
    int maxStatements = scan.nextInt();
    long[] dp = new long[maxStatements + 1];
    dp[now] = 1;
    while (maxStatements > 0) {
      String add = scan.next();
      if (add.equals("f")) {
        now++;
      } else {
        for (int k = 1; k <= now; k++) {
          dp[k] = ((dp[k] + dp[k - 1]) % MOD);
        }
      }
      maxStatements--;
    }
    System.out.println(dp[now]);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice]. This is because the given code contains a for loop that iterates `n` times, where `n` is the number of statements given as input.

The time complexity of this loop is O(n), as the for loop has a constant number of operations inside it for each iteration.

The overall time complexity of the given code is O(n), as the loop iterates n times and each operation inside the loop has O(1) time complexity.</s>
