<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    while (sc.hasNext()) {
      int n = sc.nextInt();
      if (n % 2 != 0) {
        System.out.println("Ehab");
      } else {
        System.out.println("Mahmoud");
      }
    }
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]2[/choice]. It is because the code uses a loop that iterates through each integer entered by the user until the user stops entering integers. As the loop runs n times, where n is the number of integers entered by the user, the time complexity of the given code is O(n).</s>
