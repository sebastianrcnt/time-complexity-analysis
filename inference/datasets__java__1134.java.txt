<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader st = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    StringTokenizer s = new StringTokenizer(st.readLine());
    long n = Long.parseLong(s.nextToken());
    long k = Long.parseLong(s.nextToken());
    long ans = k / n;
    if (k % n != 0) ans++;
    System.out.println(ans + "");
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice]. This is because the code has two input variables (n and k) and it reads both of them using the `stringTokenizer` class, which takes O(logn) time to tokenize the string entered by the user. Additionally, the code computes and outputs k/n as the answer, which takes O(1) constant time to execute. Thus, the overall time complexity of the code is O(logn).</s>
