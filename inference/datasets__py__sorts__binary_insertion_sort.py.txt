[choice]0[/choice] The given code's time complexity is O(1) because the binary insertion sort algorithm has a fixed number of operations regardless of the size of the input. Specifically, the for loop runs from i=1 to i=n-1, and within that loop, the while loop runs from low=0 to high=i-1. Additionally, the for loop that inserts the value_to_insert into the sorted list runs from j=i to j=low-1. Therefore, the total number of operations in the worst case is n+i-1+i-1=2n-1, which is constant with respect to the input size.</s>
