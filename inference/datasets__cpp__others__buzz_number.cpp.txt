<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
/**
 * @file
 * @brief A buzz number is a number that is either divisible by 7 or has last
 * digit as 7.
 */
#include <iostream>

/** main function */
int main() {
    int n, t;
    std::cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        std::cin >> n;
        if ((n % 7 == 0) || (n % 10 == 7))
            std::cout << n << " is a buzz number" << std::endl;
        else
            std::cout << n << " is not a buzz number" << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1.[/choice] This is because the code reads n integers and for each integer it performs a constant time check to see if it is a buzz number. Therefore the time complexity is O(logn) as the size of the input affects only the logarithmic term.</s>
