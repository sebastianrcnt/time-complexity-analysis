<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class alex {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int sum = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      sum = sum + (4 * (i - 1));
    }
    System.out.println(sum);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice] 2 [/choice].

Explanation:
The time complexity of the given code is calculated based on the number of operations performed in the loop. In the given code, the number of operations is directly proportional to the number of iterations of the loop, therefore the time complexity of the code is O(n).</s>
