Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
/*
 * Shell Sort sorts an array based on  insertion sort algorithm
 * more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort
 *
 */
export function shellSort(items) {
  let interval = 1

  while (interval < items.length / 3) {
    interval = interval * 3 + 1
  }

  while (interval > 0) {
    for (let outer = interval; outer < items.length; outer++) {
      const value = items[outer]
      let inner = outer

      while (inner > interval - 1 && items[inner - interval] >= value) {
        items[inner] = items[inner - interval]
        inner = inner - interval
      }
      items[inner] = value
    }
    interval = (interval - 1) / 3
  }
  return items
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]4[/choice].

This is because the code contains nested loops. In the outer loop, it runs 'n' times, and in the inner loop, it runs 'n' times for every iteration of the outer loop. Therefore, the total number of iterations is 'n * n'. Hence, we can say that the time complexity of the given code is O(n^2), which means that the running time of the code increases quadratically as the size of the input increases.</s>
