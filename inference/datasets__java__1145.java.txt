Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.*;

public class CF1068A {
  public CF1068A() {
    FS scan = new FS();
    long n = scan.nextLong(), m = scan.nextLong(), k = scan.nextLong(), l = scan.nextLong();
    long ceil = (k + l + m - 1) / m;
    if (k + l <= n && ceil * m <= n) System.out.println(ceil);
    else System.out.println(-1);
  }

  class FS {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer("");

    public String next() {
      while (!st.hasMoreTokens()) {
        try {
          st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
        } catch (Exception e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
      }
      return st.nextToken();
    }

    public int nextInt() {
      return Integer.parseInt(next());
    }

    public long nextLong() {
      return Long.parseLong(next());
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new CF1068A();
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice]. 

Explanation:
The code reads input from standard input using a BufferedReader and a StringTokenizer. The time complexity of reading input from standard input is O(n), where n is the size of the input. However, in this case, the input is small enough that it will not be a significant factor.

The main part of the code calculates k/m*m - 1/m. In the worst case, this calculation takes O(logn) time. Since l <= n and k + l <= n, k + l is also bounded by n. Therefore, k/m is at most n/m, and m is at least 1. 

The k/m*m term is at most n/m, and 1/m is at most 1/n. Hence, k/m*m - 1/m takes at most 2*n + 2 = 4n.

The time complexity of the CF1068A class as a whole depends on the time complexity of the FS class. Since the FS class reads input in O(n) time, the total time complexity of the CF1068A class is 4n + O(1), which is O(n). 

Therefore, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice].</s>
