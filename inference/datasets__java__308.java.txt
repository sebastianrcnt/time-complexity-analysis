<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;

class GFG {

  static int sequence(int n) {

    if (n == 1 || n == 2) return 1;
    else return sequence(sequence(n - 1)) + sequence(n - sequence(n - 1));
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {

    int n = 10;

    System.out.println(sequence(n));
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]2[/choice].


Explanation:
The function sequence(int n) is recursively called to find the sequence of Fibonacci numbers. However, this recursion is not done efficiently, because each time the function is called it creates new recursive calls instead of reusing existing ones. Therefore, the time complexity of the given code is O(n), where n is the length of the input sequence.

To optimize this code, we can use dynamic programming to store the results of previous function calls and reuse them when necessary. This will reduce the number of function calls and improve the time complexity from O(n) to O(logn).</s>
