<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
class Test {

  static int arr[] = {10, 324, 45, 90, 9808};

  static int largest() {

    int i;

    int max = arr[0];

    for (i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];

    return max;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    System.out.println("Largest in given array is " + largest());
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice]. This is because, in the given code, the largest() method runs n times (n is the length of the array), and each iteration runs in constant time O(1). So the time complexity of the given code is O(n).</s>
