Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
class MinimumDistance {

  int minDist(int arr[], int n, int x, int y) {

    int i = 0;

    int min_dist = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    int prev = 0;

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {

      if (arr[i] == x || arr[i] == y) {

        prev = i;

        break;
      }
    }

    for (; i < n; i++) {

      if (arr[i] == x || arr[i] == y) {

        if (arr[prev] != arr[i] && (i - prev) < min_dist) {

          min_dist = i - prev;

          prev = i;

        } else prev = i;
      }
    }

    return min_dist;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    MinimumDistance min = new MinimumDistance();

    int arr[] = {3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 3, 0, 0, 5, 4, 8, 3};

    int n = arr.length;

    int x = 3;

    int y = 6;

    System.out.println(
        "Minimum distance between " + x + " and " + y + " is " + min.minDist(arr, n, x, y));
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice] (O(logn)). This is because the algorithm iterates through the array once to find the first occurrence of `x` and `y`, but then it uses a binary search approach to find the minimum distance between these two elements. The time complexity of binary search is O(logn) in the average and worst cases.

Here's a breakdown of how the algorithm works:

1. The `minDist` method takes in an array `arr`, its length `n`, and the values of `x` and `y`. It initializes three variables: `min_dist` to Integer.MAX_VALUE, `prev` to -1, and a local variable `i` to 0.
2. The algorithm then iterates through the array to find the first occurrence of `x` or `y`. If the current element is `x` or `y`, it stores its index in the `prev` variable and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it iterates until a valid occurrence of `x` or `y` is found. The time complexity of this initial iteration is O(n).
3. The algorithm then enters a loop that iterates over the array from index `i+1` to `n-1`. For each element in this range, it checks if the element is `x` or `y`. If it is not, it continues. If the element is `x` or `y`, the algorithm updates the `min_dist` and `prev` variables. The time complexity of this loop is O(n).
4. The algorithm then leaves the loop and returns the `min_dist` variable.

In total, the time complexity of the `minDist` method is O(n), but the time complexity of the binary search approach within the loop is O(logn) in the average and worst cases. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(logn).</s>
