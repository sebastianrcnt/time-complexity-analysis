<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class GFG {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int c = sc.nextInt();
    int ans = 0;
    int t = sc.nextInt();
    int arr[] = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int nn = sc.nextInt();
      ans += a;
      if (b < c) {
        ans += (t - nn) * (c - b);
      }
    }
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]2.[/choice]
The given code has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of inputs the program reads. This is because the for loop iterates through n times, as specified by the value of the variable "i". Additionally, the operations within the for loop, such as scanning input integers and adding to the "ans" variable, take constant time to perform, further contributing to the overall O(n) time complexity.</s>
