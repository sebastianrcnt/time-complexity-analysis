Explanation:
The main part of the algorithm used a priority queue to store nodes by their rank. Each time a node was selected, its rank was computed in O(1) operations and other nodes were removed from it in O(1) operations as well. So, the outer loop of the algorithm runs ln(n) times for the worst case, where n is the number of nodes. Inside the loop, various operations (such as heapq.heappush/heappop, set operations) have constant time complexity. Heapq operations are performed using a priority queue, which has the logarithmic worst case time complexity. Therefore, the overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(logn).</s>
