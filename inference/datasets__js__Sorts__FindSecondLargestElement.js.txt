<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
/*
 * Find Second Largest is a real technical interview question.
 * Chances are you will be asked to find the second largest value
 * inside of an array of numbers. You must also be able to filter
 * out duplicate values.  It's important to know how to do this with
 * clean code that is also easy to explain.
 *
 * Resources:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set
 */

const secondLargestElement = (array) => {
  const largestElement = Math.max(...array)
  let element = -Number.MAX_VALUE

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (element < array[i] && array[i] !== largestElement) {
      element = array[i]
    }
  }

  return element
}

export { secondLargestElement }


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]2[/choice]. This is because the code has a time complexity of O(n) since the for loop iterates through the entire array and performs a constant operation (a comparison) on each element.</s>
