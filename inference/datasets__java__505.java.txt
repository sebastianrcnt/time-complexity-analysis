Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Arrays;

class GFG {

  static int minOps(int arr[], int n, int k) {

    Arrays.sort(arr);

    int max = arr[arr.length - 1];

    int res = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

      if ((max - arr[i]) % k != 0) return -1;
      else res += (max - arr[i]) / k;
    }

    return res;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int arr[] = {21, 33, 9, 45, 63};

    int n = arr.length;

    int k = 6;

    System.out.println(minOps(arr, n, k));
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]4[/choice] (O(n^2)). 


Explanation:

The main function 'minOps' takes three parameters - the sorted array 'arr', its length 'n' and the value 'k'. 

The first operation in the 'minOps' function is to sort the array 'arr' in ascending order. This is done using the 'Arrays.sort(arr)' method, which has a time complexity of O(nlogn). Hence the time complexity of the loop that includes this method is [choice]3[/choice] (O(nlogn)).

The second operation is to calculate the maximum value of the array. This is done using the 'max = arr[arr.length - 1];' statement, which takes O(1) time as accessing an array index is constant time.

The third operation is a loop that runs 'n' times. During this loop, for each element 'arr[i]' in the array, the program checks if the absolute difference between the maximum value 'max' and the current element 'arr[i]', divided by 'k', is an integer. If it is not an integer, the loop terminates and returns -1. If it is an integer, the difference is added to the variable 'res'.

The time complexity of this loop is [choice]1[/choice] (O(logn)), since every time the loop calculates the difference 'max - arr[i]', it has to do an integer division operation, and as mentioned earlier, accessing an array index takes O(1) time.

Therefore, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]4[/choice] (O(n^2)).</s>
