<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AlexAndARhombus {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    System.out.println(n * n + (n - 1) * (n - 1));
    sc.close();
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]4[/choice]. The reason for this is that the code uses nested loops which have a combined time complexity of O(n^2).</s>
