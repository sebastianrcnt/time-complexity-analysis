Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])

Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Given Code:
    /* Binary Search: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm
 *
 * Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval
 * in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the
 * search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval
 * to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the
 * value is found or the interval is empty.

[choice]3[/choice] The given code has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the binary search algorithm iterates through the array once, and the recursive function calls itself n times. The iterative function calls the same steps n times, but it avoids multiple function calls and optimizes the performance.</s>
