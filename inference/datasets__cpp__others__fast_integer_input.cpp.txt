Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
/**
 * @file
 * @brief Read integers from stdin continuously as they are entered without
 * waiting for the `\n` character
 */
#include <iostream>

/** Function to read the number from stdin. The function reads input until a non
 * numeric character is entered.
 */
void fastinput(int *number) {
    // variable to indicate sign of input integer
    bool negative = false;
    register int c;
    *number = 0;

    // extract current character from buffer
    c = std::getchar();
    if (c == '-') {
        // number is negative
        negative = true;

        // extract the next character from the buffer
        c = std::getchar();
    }

    // Keep on extracting characters if they are integers
    // i.e ASCII Value lies from '0'(48) to '9' (57)
    for (; (c > 47 && c < 58); c = std::getchar())
        *number = *number * 10 + c - 48;

    // if scanned input has a negative sign, negate the
    // value of the input number
    if (negative)
        *(number) *= -1;
}

/** Main function */
int main() {
    int number;
    fastinput(&number);
    std::cout << number << std::endl;
    return 0;
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice]. This is because the given code reads integers from the user continuously without waiting for the '\n' character, hence each input integer takes constant time. However, since there are multiple integers being read, the total time taken for reading them all will increase linearly with the number of integers, hence the time complexity is O(n).</s>
