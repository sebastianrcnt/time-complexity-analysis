<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
/*
 * Linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target
 * value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list
 * for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements
 * have been searched.
 */
function SearchArray(searchNum, ar, output = (v) => console.log(v)) {
  const position = Search(ar, searchNum)
  if (position !== -1) {
    output('The element was found at ' + (position + 1))
  } else {
    output('The element not found')
  }
}

// Search “theArray” for the specified “key” value
function Search(theArray, key) {
  for (let n = 0; n < theArray.length; n++) {
    if (theArray[n] === key) {
      return n
    }
  }
  return -1
}

export { SearchArray, Search }

// const ar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
// SearchArray(3, ar)
// SearchArray(4, ar)
// SearchArray(11, ar)


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]2[/choice]. This is because the given code implements a linear search algorithm in the `Search()` function, which has a time complexity of O(n).</s>
