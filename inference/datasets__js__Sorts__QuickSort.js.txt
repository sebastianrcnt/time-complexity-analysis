Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
/**
 * @function QuickSort
 * @description Quick sort is a comparison sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer strategy.
 * @param {Integer[]} items - Array of integers
 * @return {Integer[]} - Sorted array.
 * @see [QuickSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
 */
function quickSort(items) {
  const length = items.length

  if (length <= 1) {
    return items
  }
  const PIVOT = items[0]
  const GREATER = []
  const LESSER = []

  for (let i = 1; i < length; i++) {
    if (items[i] > PIVOT) {
      GREATER.push(items[i])
    } else {
      LESSER.push(items[i])
    }
  }

  const sorted = [...quickSort(LESSER), PIVOT, ...quickSort(GREATER)]
  return sorted
}

export { quickSort }


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]3[/choice].

Explanation:
The time complexity of the given code is O(n), where n is the number of items in the input array. This is because the algorithm performs n operations on the input array. Specifically, there are n comparisons performed on each element, which gives n operation performed on each element. And as there are n elements in total, hence the total number of operations is n * n = n.</s>
