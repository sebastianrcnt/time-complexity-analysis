<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
/**
 * @file
 * @brief A happy number is a number whose sum of digits is calculated until the
 * sum is a single digit, and this sum turns out to be 1
 */

#include <iostream>

/**
 * Checks if a decimal number is a happy number
 * \returns true if happy else false
 */
template <typename T>
bool is_happy(T n) {
    T s = 0;              // stores sum of digits
    while (n > 9) {       // while number is > 9, there are more than 1 digit
        while (n != 0) {  // get digit
            T d = n % 10;
            s += d;
            n /= 10;
        }
        n = s;
        s = 0;
    }
    return (n == 1) ? true : false;  // true if k == 1
}

/** Main function */
int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter a number:";
    std::cin >> n;

    if (is_happy(n))
        std::cout << n << " is a happy number" << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << n << " is not a happy number" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice], which is O(logn). 

This is because in the while loop, the factorial of n is being calculated which is O(n) space complexity in worst case.  Additionally, in the inner while loop, square roots of the number are being calculated which also has O(sqrt(n)) space/time complexity. However, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(logn) as the inner loop runs at most logn times. 

In conclusion, the time complexity of the given code is O(logn).</s>
