<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt(), s = sc.nextInt();
    int coins;
    if (s % n != 0) coins = s / n + 1;
    else coins = s / n;

    System.out.println(coins);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]2[/choice].
This is because the code performs a linear operation by calculating the value of `coins` where the value of `s` is divided by the value of `n`.</s>
