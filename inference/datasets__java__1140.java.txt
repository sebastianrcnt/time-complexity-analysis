<s> 
Analyize the time complexity of the given code. Include your choice in the [choice][/choice] tag, and only include the number of the option. (e.g. [choice]1[/choice])


Given Code:
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class A {
  public static void main(String ar[]) throws Exception {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    String s1[] = br.readLine().split(" ");
    int n = Integer.parseInt(s1[0]);
    int S = Integer.parseInt(s1[1]);
    if (S % n == 0) System.out.println(S / n);
    else System.out.println(S / n + 1);
  }
}


Options:
    0. O(1)
    1. O(logn)
    2. O(n)
    3. O(nlogn)
    4. O(n^2)

Among the Options above, the time complexity of the given code is [choice]1[/choice]. The reason is that the program reads a single line of input with two space-separated integers, which is a linear operation on the input. The rest of the program (including the string manipulation and integer arithmetic) is O(1), as it has a constant time complexity regardless of the input size. Thus, the overall time complexity of the program is O(1), which is the first option above.</s>
